This is a NodeJS ReactJS Application. I wanted to build an application using which I can transfer code between multiple systems.

It is built with socket.io

## Description

I used Ace Editor for the code editor on the website. For my use case, there was no **delta**, so I created my delta function which improved the performance. This ensured that only the changes were broadcasted and not the entire code.

## Upcoming

* I have to deploy this application.
* Add database layer
* Create a URL-based system for creating multiple "rooms" for people to collaborate with.
* Authentication

## Deployment

For deployment, I am trying to use Microsoft Azure due to the availability of free credits through the Student's Scholarship.

## Links

The backend is currently having issues with deployment, hence the interface is not accessible. You can watch the demonstration video below!
